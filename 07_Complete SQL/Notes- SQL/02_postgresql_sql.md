### Setting up a PostgreSQL Database

#### Step 1: Start the PostgreSQL Service
Start the PostgreSQL service to ensure it’s running on your system:

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```

#### Step 2: Create a Database
Create a new database for your chai and city data:

```bash
createdb chai_and_city
```

This creates a new database called `chai_and_city` in PostgreSQL.

#### Step 3: Connecting to the Database
Connect to your newly created database using PostgreSQL command line interface:

```bash
psql -d chai_and_city
```

This will prompt you to enter your password. Enter your password. Here, `-d` is a flag that specifies the database you want to connect to.

Once connected, you can start using PostgreSQL commands that we will learn in the next chapter.

### Connecting to PostgreSQL with pgAdmin

pgAdmin is a graphical interface for managing PostgreSQL databases. Follow these steps to connect and manage your database using pgAdmin:

1. **Download and Install pgAdmin:** Go to the official pgAdmin website and install it for your operating system.
2. **Connect to your local PostgreSQL Server:** Open pgAdmin and create a new server connection. For the hostname, use localhost and enter your PostgreSQL username and password.
3. **Create a Database:** Right-click on your server in pgAdmin, select "Create," and choose "Database." Name the database `chai_and_cities`.
4. **Manage Data Visually:** You can now use pgAdmin’s graphical interface to create tables, insert data, and run queries.
