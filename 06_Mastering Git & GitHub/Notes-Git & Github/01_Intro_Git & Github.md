# Git and Github  

## 🛠 Introduction to Git  

Git is a **version control system** that allows you to track changes to your files and collaborate with others. It manages the history of your code and helps merge changes from different branches.  

If terms like **version control**, **branches**, and **merges** sound unfamiliar, don’t worry! This tutorial will guide you through the basics.

## 🖥️ Git and Github Are Different  

### **What is Git?**  
Git is a **version control system** used to track changes to your files. It’s:  
- Free and open-source software.  
- Available on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.  
- A software that runs locally on your computer.  

### **What is Github?**  
Github is a **web-based platform** for hosting Git repositories. It allows you to:  
- Store and share code online.  
- Collaborate with others on projects.  

💡 **Note:** Github is one of the most popular Git hosting services, but it’s not the only one.

## 🔄 A Little About Version Control Systems  

Version control systems manage the **history of your code**.
 They:  
- Allow you to track changes to your files.  
- Enable collaboration with other developers.  

### 🎮 Think of version control as a **checkpoint in a game**:  
You can always go back to a previous checkpoint if needed.  

#### **Before Git:**  
Early version control systems like **SCCS (Source Code Control System)** were proprietary and expensive.
 Git replaced these systems, making version control **accessible** and **user-friendly**.  

Other version control systems include:  
- Subversion (SVN)  
- CVS  
- Perforce
