## Rebase in Git

Git rebase is a powerful Git feature used to change the base of a branch. It effectively allows you to move a branch to a new starting point, usually a different commit, by "replaying" the commits from the original base onto the new base. This can be useful for keeping a cleaner, linear project history.

Some people prefer to use rebase over the merge command because:
- It allows you to keep the commit history cleaner and easier to understand.
- It lets you make changes to the code without affecting the original branch.

### Merge Commits

A merge commit combines two or more commits into one. It is created when you merge two or more branches into a single branch. The merge commit contains all the changes from the original branches and is used to keep the project history clean and easy to understand.

## Rebase

Rebase is a powerful tool in Git that allows you to move a branch to a new starting point by replaying commits from the original base onto the new base. This can be useful for maintaining a linear project history.

### Example: Using `git rebase`

Suppose you have a feature branch called `feature-branch` that you want to rebase onto the `main` branch.

#### Steps:
1. Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

2. Rebase the branch onto `main`:

```bash
git rebase main
```

This will replay the commits from `feature-branch` on top of the latest changes in `main`.

3. Resolve any conflicts (if necessary):
   - Open the conflicting files.
   - Use conflict markers to identify and resolve the conflicts.
   - After resolving, mark the files as resolved:

```bash
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
```

### Important Notes:
- Avoid using `--force` with rebase as it can cause issues with the project history.
- Always ensure your team is aware when using rebase to avoid complications.

## Git Reflog

Git reflog is a command that shows the history of your commits. It helps you debug and understand the history of your project.

### Viewing the Reflog

```bash
git reflog
```

This will display the history of your commits. Each entry includes a reference you can use to access a specific commit.

### Finding a Specific Commit

You can find a specific commit using:

```bash
git reflog <commit-hash>
```

### Recovering Lost Commits or Changes

If you accidentally delete a branch or lose changes, you can recover them using the reflog.

1. Find the reference to the commit:

```bash
git reflog
```

2. Reset your branch to that reference:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

Or, use `HEAD@{n}` to reset to the nth commit before the current one:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```
